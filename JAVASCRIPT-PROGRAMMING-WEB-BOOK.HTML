<h1>Understanding Variable types</h1> <BR> So far, you've seen example of variable value that are number.
in JavaScript, the varible values or types, can include number, strings,Booleans, and nulls.<br>
Unlike stricter programming languages, JavaScript does not force you to be declare the type of variable when you define it.<br> Instead, JavaScript allows virtually any value to be assigned to any variable. Although this gives you flexibility in coding, you need to be careful because you can end up with some unexpected results--especially when adding numbers.<br><h5>&nbsp;</h5>
 <hr> <h4>&#8226; The = symbol </h4>   <h4>&#8226; resered word </h4>  <h4>&#8226; When you need to debug the program, it will de easier to recognize what the variable rerpresents</h4>

<h1>Numbers</h1>
Number variable are just that--numbers. JavaScript does not require number to be declared as integers, floating-point numbers, or any other number type. Instead, any number is seen as juust another,whether it is 7, --2, 3.453. or anything else. The number will remain the same type unless you perform a calculation to change the type. For instance, if you use an integer in a variable, it won't sunddenly have decimal place unless you perform a calculation of some sort to change it (dividing unevenly, for instance).<br>
As you've seen, you define a number variable by using the keyword var.



<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h4>var  variablename=number;</h4>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Here are some example:
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h4>var  paycheck=1200;</h4>
<h4>var  phonebill=29.99;</h4>
<h4>var  savings=0;</h4>
<h4>var  sparetime=-24.5;</h4>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
If you need to use a particularly long number, JavaScript has exponential notation.
